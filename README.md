# Play connect 4
This is an application is my version of the game connect-4. It is a 2 player game and the idea behind it was to make a playable version of an object oriented kata I did to find the winner on codewars. I decided to make this to improve upon my understanding of both React and Redux as well as my core JavaScript skills.
